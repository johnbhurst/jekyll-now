Hi, I'm John Hurst.

I'm a software developer based in Wellington, New Zealand.

Since 2005 I have been working in various different roles at [Red Energy](www.redenergy.com.au) in Melbourne, Australia.

These are the technologies I have been using extensively in the last few years:

* [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/index.html) and [Groovy](http://groovy-lang.org/)
* [Oracle Database](https://www.oracle.com/database/index.html)
* [Spring Framework](https://spring.io/) and [Spring Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/)
* [Gradle](https://gradle.org/)
* [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/)
* [Google BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/)

### More Information

Some of my hobbies include:

* Experimenting with different languages and techniques for solving the [N Queens Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle): here is my [GitHub repo](https://github.com/johnbhurst/nqueens) with the code and some results.
* Supporting NZ Live Music at [Lovelands](http://www.lovelands.co.nz/), where I video the bands for our [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzItdCnT_ZABecyRde4wFaQ).
* Mountain biking, especially at [Puketiro Forest near my house](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MYqkXeWQHg).
